1.5.2a
---------
*) Only enable keep alive from CGI scripts with content lengths and if
   keep alive is enabled on the server
*) Delete preceding white space on CGI headers
*) Fix HTTP/1.1 protocal bug (if agent requested HTTP/1.1, server responded
   with HTTP, now responds with HTTP/1.0 which is spec)
*) Added SERVER_ROOT CGI var
*) Should escape # character in directory indexing
*) Add MaxRequestsPerChild support, so that errors in state can be swept under
   the carpet

Fixes for 1.5.2
------------------
*) Changed httpd_getline rfc822 line wrap to check for validity of the next bits
   before attempting to see them
*) Changed imagemap.c so relative URLs actually work
*) Don't core dump on a method only request
*) reset errno to 0 in send_fp so we break out of loop
*) somewhere we stopped killing cgi scripts on SIGALRM and SIGPIPE
*) changed group handling support to support multiple groups again
*) reset content_length before scanning cgi headers, not after
*) don't free env var in replace (it uses allocate now)
*) Only look for path_info if its part of the requested URL (as opposed
   to keep looking until you hit a real directory)
*) Make make_dirstr() in util.c return / instead of null if n = 1
